# VI_masterclass

This repository contains materials for the two lectures I gave on the topics of modern Variational inference and deep generative models (mainly VAEs and Normalising flows), as part of the workshop on Variational inference organised jointly by the postdocs of [CoSInES](https://www.cosines.org) and [Bayes4Health](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/bayes-for-health) projects. 

The notebooks can be run easily using ggogle colab.
